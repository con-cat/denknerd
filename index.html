<p>Hi! I'm Paul, currently a PhD student in the 
    <a href="http://phoenix.inria.fr">Phoenix team</a> of
<a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux">INRIA Bordeaux</a>. </p>

<p>My work is on open programming platforms and how these might
support verification. My interests (the marketable ones, anyway) include
compilers, type theory, functional programming and recently software
architectures and how they can be mapped to concrete, property-ensuring programming frameworks.
Previously I studied computing science at the <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Center">Utrecht
    University</a>, where I did my thesis under <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Wouter Swierstra</a>'s supervision.</p>

<p>On this site you'll find a list of my recent work, as well as pointers to slightly more off-topic things such as my hobbies &mdash; being a geek, they're mostly to be found online.
