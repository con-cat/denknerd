<p>Hi! I'm Paul! I have done various things, and will probably do more in the future.</p>

<p>On this site you'll find a list of my recent work, as well as
    pointers to slightly more off-topic things such as my hobbies
    &mdash; many are to be found online. There's also
    the <a href="/soapbox.html">soapbox</a>, where i might, from time
    to time, expound on issues that grab my attention. I tend to get
    wound up about privacy, feminism, animal rights, music, gender,
    among others.</p>
