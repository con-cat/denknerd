<p>Hi!  I'm Paul!  I'm a recent arrival to Melbourne and i'm looking
for software development projects.  I do Racket, Haskell, Lisp, pretty
much anything functional, but i will consider other options, for food.
Before, i was a PhD student in computer science at
  <a href="http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/pwalt">INRIA Bordeaux</a>.
  Before that, i was an MSc student
  at <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Utrecht
  University</a>.</p>

<p>On this site you'll find <strike>a list of my recent academic work,
    as well as</strike> pointers to slightly more off-topic things
    such as my hobbies &mdash; many are to be found online. There also
    used to be the soapbox, where i used to expound on issues that
    grabbed my attention. I tend to get wound up about privacy,
    feminism, animal rights, music, gender, etc.</p>
