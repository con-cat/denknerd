<p>Hi! I'm Paul, currently a PhD student in the 
    <a href="http://phoenix.inria.fr/paul-van-der-walt">Phoenix team</a> at <a
            href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux">INRIA Bordeaux</a>.
    Previously i studied computing science in <a
            href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Center">Utrecht</a>,
    where i did my thesis under <a
            href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Wouter
        Swierstra</a>'s supervision.</p>

<!---
 <p>My work is on open programming platforms and how these might
support verification. My interests (the marketable ones, anyway) include
compilers, type theory, functional programming and recently software
architectures and how they can be mapped to concrete, property-ensuring programming frameworks.

<p>On this site you'll find a list of my recent work, as well as pointers to
    slightly more off-topic things such as my hobbies &mdash; many are to
    be found online. There's also the recently-introduced <a href="/soapbox.html">soapbox</a>, where
i might, from time to time, expound on issues that grab my attention. I tend to
get wound up about privacy, feminism, animal rights, music, gender, among others.</p>
