  This paper explores the recent addition to Agda enabling
_reflection_, in the style of Lisp, MetaML, and Template Haskell.
It gives a brief introduction to using reflection, and details the intricacies
of using reflection to automate certain proofs using _proof by
  reflection_.
It presents a library that
can be used for automatically quoting a class of concrete Agda terms
to a simple, user-defined
inductive data type, alleviating the burden a programmer usually faces
when using reflection in a practical setting.
