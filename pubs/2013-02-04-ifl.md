This paper explores the recent addition to Agda enabling
_reflection_, in the style of Lisp and Template Haskell.
It gives a brief introduction to using reflection, and details the complexities encountered when
automating certain proofs with _proof by
reflection_.
It presents a library that
can be used for automatically quoting a class of concrete Agda terms
to a non-dependent, user-defined
inductive data type, alleviating some of the burden a programmer faces
when using reflection in a practical setting.
