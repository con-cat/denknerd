This project explores the recent addition to Agda enabling reflection,
in the style of Lisp, MetaML, and Template Haskell. It illustrates
several possible applications of reflection that arise in dependently
typed programming, and details the limitations of the current
implementation of reflection. Examples of type-safe metaprograms are
given that illustrate the power of reflection coupled with a
dependently typed language. Among other things the limitations
inherent in having quote and unquote implemented as keywords are
highlighted. The fact that lambda terms are returned without typing
information is discussed, and a solution is presented. Also provided
is a detailed users' guide to the reflection API and a library of
working code examples to illustrate how various common tasks can be
performed, along with suggestions for an updated reflection API in a
future version of Agda.
