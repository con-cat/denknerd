title: Girls as people
---

Laurie Penny makes a very good point. A fiery, angry point, which very unfortunately
is totally spot-on. Why can't we as a society get past teaching people old and destructive
gender roles, and why can't we get past media frenzies over slut shaming, or moralising, or
judging, or generally getting in a knot about what girls do or don't do. When will we
get our act together and not just say, but act, as if there are more important things in life
than being sexy.
