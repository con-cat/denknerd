title: Mortified to be human
---

The following is a desperate rant, a helpless venting of my frustration. I am
sorry for its length and poor quality, but nobody is likely to read
this. If someone does, however, i challenge them to disagree with me.

This sentiment, that of being generally-speaking mortified to be human, of
feeling guilty for all the things people around me as well as i myself get up
to, has been a lingering, background sentiment in my head for a very long time.
Every time i read about some or other atrocity or have thought deeply about
whatever injustice of the day was being committed, this feeling would resurface
or intensify, only to be backgrounded again whenever i got distracted. The last
two weeks or so, however, it's been incredibly strong.

One of the difficulties is that it often leaves me feeling terribly helpless.
Almost daily, i read about injustices, or things i consider to be injustices
but which are by and large considered normal by the majority of people. Often,
though, these are systemic problems: in Ireland an involuntarily inflicted,
unwanted foetus is considered to have equal (nay, superior) rights to its
mother [1]. On a direct level, this is an obvious outrage: why do we (who is
we?) stay silent and therefore conducive to such abuse, such direct and
flagrant violation of someone's body? But what can i, as an individual, do
about it? On a different level, and on a stupendously grander scale, there are
people getting excited about this foetus' "right to life" (i refer to those who
would deprive this woman of the right to rid herself of this nightmare), while
every year, millions upon literally millions of animals are raised in
horrendous conditions only to be brutally slaughtered (a word which would be jarring if applied
to humans -- why?), so that "good people"
such as my own family, friends, and acquaintances can regularly have their
shallow comfort catered to, the comfort of going to a butchery and buying a
neat and tidy block of flesh of whatever unfortunate being they happen to
whimsically want to stick in a dish that evening [2]. Because of course, human
animals have infinite rights over those species we conveniently categorise as
animals, and therefore free of rights (in case it's not clear: i am being
sarcastic). This is the epitome of speciesism.

Yet that is far from being all. Obvious examples i don't even feel like diving
into are easy to find (think current events: ISIS/Syria, Gaza, Chibok
kidnapping, any number of sexist (micro- *and* macro-)aggressions [3], ...), all having a
common element: [it feels as if] i, personally, cannot do anything at all about
them. Even indirectly. And i feel ashamed for all of us.

Wait, you say, even indirectly? Surely you can at least better your own life,
by lowering your own carbon footprint, using a bicycle instead of a car, by
trying to ignore people's gender when dealing with them, by eating as
consciously and carefully as possible? You can talk to people around you about
why you do this, and you can set a good example. Right?  This is true, but
there are two challenges which really frustrate me. I'm certainly not arguing
against doing any of the above, but:

- even if i try super hard, my very existence is an ecological/humanitarian burden, and
- i cannot even convince my own closest friends that, for example, the practice
  of eating animals is extremely detrimental to the environment, never mind barbaric.

I will elaborate on the first point. For example, it is true that it's better
than nothing, my preference for the bicycle versus a personal car. It's just
really frustrating to realise that merely by being alive in a developed
country, i am participating in, accessory to, the destruction of the planet and
the exploitation, destruction even, of defenseless people and animals.

The office i work in is cooled to
uncomfortable temperatures during the summer; i eat food which, however
ethically i try and source it, will have been transported far and wide,
consuming fossil fuels on the way; i use online services which
are hosted in huge, power-hungry (= greenhouse gas) data centres; i invariably waste enormous
amounts of water while using the toilet at home which copiously flushes... The list
goes on. And the depressing thing is that i am convinced that if we in the
developed world would simply choose, all at once, tomorrow, to avoid using a
personal car as much as possible, to switch off the thousands of electrical
devices on stand-by with which we are surrounded, to eat vegetarian and local food, we would be
able to seriously curb  (even if it were perhaps too late to reverse) climate
change, as well as probably take steps towards alleviating world hunger. That's
just one example, and none of the changes proposed are at all radical or would
pose any horrible inconvenience, it's just that we, myself included, are
horribly, criminally, complacent; unwilling to give up even token amounts of
luxury. I don't want this rant to devolve into purely environmental issues:
consider also the ease with which we (myself included) buy clothing and
electronics which is produced by exploited children and incredibly impoverished
factory workers. Although, if i want to participate in modern civilisation, i
cannot do without my computer, which will almost certainly have been produced
extremely unethically. In short: i feel powerless, even at a personal level, to
meaningfully change the world for the better.

The second point equally has to do with powerlessness. I will give an example.
Almost everybody i interact with daily, be it friends, family or colleagues,
eats meat. Whenever the subject comes up (for example, when a vegetarian option
isn't available in a restaurant), and i have put forth my point of view
(however un-abrasively), i am invariably met with something on a spectrum from bemusement
to indignation. When asked, people will explain how this is *just the way
things work*, how animals (basically) are *there for our consumption*, *aren't
really suffering*, etc. I am of the strong conviction that this must be what it was
like living in a slave State in the 18th century: one might have been deeply convinced
that it was immoral to keep or trade slaves, but the law condoned it, your
parents probably held slaves, and everybody had reams of rhetoric justifying
the practice on various grounds ranging from the religious to the pragmatic to
the patently absurd. The tragedy though, is that animals are not going to stage
a rebellion, ever. No matter how brutally we might treat them, or how little
respect we might have for them. Humans have ultimate dominion over them. The same
goes for exploited factory workers producing our electronics and clothing. It is by
our treatment of the powerless and voiceless, that one truly learns of human
nature, leading me to be deeply ashamed of being human.

In summary, i feel mortified to be part of a group of beings who pretend to be
benevolent, while tolerating and perpetuating myriad injustices. It is my deep
(and extremely unrealistic, unfortunately) wish that within 25 years at the
absolute maximum, people will look back and read about the year 2014, when
people still held animals, intelligent and feeling beings, in captivity, torturing
them to death, and eating them; thereby causing epic levels of greenhouse
gas emission (if one wasn't already convinced by the empathic/moral argument), wondering
how we could be so violent and ignorant.
All this while there is no justification for the practice: except for taste, preference, "tradition",
convenience. I trust that later, people will be mystified that we fished species into extinction, with
such criminal disregard for nature that vast amounts of ocean floor are scraped
barren while trawling for shrimp, or that "by-catch" kills as many or more fish as
are being harvested. I wish people of the future will look back
and wonder how people could possibly have participated in such atrocities. How
people could have continued driving to work and back without using bicycles. How people
could have bought clothing from unethical producers. I
will be one of those perpetrators -- not on every count, but certainly many more than zero.
I will be responsible, i will be one of the people who didn't offer their life for the cause
or risk their livelihood campaigning for change instead of plodding along with the masses.

This is why i am ashamed, frustrated. I strongly urge people to consider what
they eat, what they wear, where it comes from; how they transport themselves,
how sparingly they use energy and other resources, how they deal with "them",
whether "them" refers to the economically underprivileged, those with a
different sexual preference, whatever beings without a voice, or the same level
of privilege as whoever the "we" in the story refers to.
