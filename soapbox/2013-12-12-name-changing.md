Apparently, there are those who would insist on name-changing if or when you
might choose to marry. I'm being obtuse, of course, because this kind of
everyday sexism isn't something I can pretend to be unaware of. But GEEZ
people, why can't we, as a society, move past this?

If you're someone who would consider marrying (another debate, some other
time), and you would -- even fleetingly -- consider that "by default" it might
make sense for (assuming cis, hetero, etc. -- a statistically average
partnership) the lady in question to take the dude in question's name, you would do well to read 
the linked article. Twice. And then internalise it, and tell all your friends to read it, too. Thing is,
we could do without this insiduous brand of normalised, accepted everyday sexism.

Can we _please_ try and work on progressing past the overtly misogynist mindset
we currently find ourselves with? It's 2013 for crying out loud.
