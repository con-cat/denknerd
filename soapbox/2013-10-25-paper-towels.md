title: What's with using paper towels?
---

A while ago I saw a TED talk everyone should watch and internalise. In it,
Joe Smith explains <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/joe_smith_how_to_use_a_paper_towel.html">how to use paper towels</a>.

The bottom line is that we all waste way, way too many resources without even realising it, and the
easiest example of a way to lessen our "eco footprint" is to use at most one single paper towel when 
drying our hands.

Now that I am paying attention, I see so many people grabbing one, two, even three paper towels and barely 
wiping their hands with them, without even thinking about it.
