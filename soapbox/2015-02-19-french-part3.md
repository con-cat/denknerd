title: The French, part 3: Patronising announcements
tags: french
---

It's been a while since i've complained bitterly about French food,
customs, culture, geography, bureaucracy, or whatever other aspect
living in France happened to confront me with now.  That's not to say
nothing has been incessantly gnawing away at my sanity, that no
insurmountable cultural chasms have been presenting themselves -- on
the contrary!  Daily i tackle -- bravely, head-on -- such horrid
assaults to common decency, as people meddling with the contents of my
plate at lunchtime, or insisting on
[touching me](2014-12-17-french-part1.html) each and every morning,
before having given me a chance to imbibe
[the swill that passes for coffee here](2014-12-19-french-part2.html).

Anyway, i digress. The axe i have to grind today concerns the
language. Not about how heavily gendered French, being a romance
language, is. Nor about how it's impossible to express the concept of
self-deprecation, or how such abominable misappropriations of the
magnificent English language as "fooding" or "footing" have made it
into the yuppie lexicon (fear not, i will return to their deplorable
love affair with gerunds another time). No, i have a much graver
gripe.

Public announcements in French are super condescending, yo
==========================================================

When i first arrived in France, i chuckled about an announcement i saw
in the tram.  There were little signboards everywhere saying *"dans le
tram je respire"*, with the well-known no-smoking symbol. "Haha," i
said to myself, naively making light of what would turn out to be a
pandemic, all-encompassing, infuriating mannerism, "haha, look how
passive-aggressive the public transport company is -- they could've
just said *do not smoke* or *smoking prohibited*. Haha." I even joked
about this with friends.

Slowly, i started noticing a trend. For example, stickers were placed
in buses, discouraging people from riding without paying: *"je monte,
je valide"*.  I started to get uneasy, but i nervously laughed it off,
thinking it could be rationalised away as still being the same
transport company -- perhaps their communications department was just
a little snarky. But i couldn't deny it much longer: i started seeing
these patronising, condescendingly-worded announcements everywhere.
There was a book lying on my coffee table, entitled *"je
réussis mon compost et lombricompost"*, and my online banking service
had buttons helpfully holding my hand by proclaiming that if i clicked
them, that in fact *"je me connecte"* and the governmental tax website straight-facedly
offers  me a  button marked  *"je paye mes impôts en ligne"*.

Why am i getting my gender-neutral undergarments in a knot, you ask?
What is so frustrating about these clumsily-worded but earnest and well-meaning phrases[^1]?
It's probably the fact that i am just not used to this mode of sentence construction,
but they all feel incredibly condescending, insulting almost. It's as if
the person writing them thinks to themselves that their target audience
must have the intellect of at most a 4-year old, or at the *very least* a serious
lack of theory of mind capabilities. As if whoever reads the instructions
clearly wouldn't have the mental fortitude to read a sentence written in
the imperative, realise it applies to them, and accordingly decide to act upon it. No,
everything should be preprocessed into the first person, so that the bumbling imbecile in the bus can
mouth the sentence to themselves, and then, as if taken by surprise at what they
just verbalised, follow the instructions they have read to themselves. Indeed,
i get on the bus. Oh! That means i validate my ticket! \*beep\* Shudder.

I finish writing now, because
if i am tired, i go to bed. Also, i send Paul fanmail.


[^1]: Of course, anybody, no matter who, who is too earnest, straight-faced
and irony-free should be immediately categorised as not to be trusted. These
shifty individuals pop up all over the place, trying their damnedest to spoil
any good old black, bile-filled sarcastic mocking.
