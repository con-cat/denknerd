I read this article in the New Statesman today. Sophia McDougall writes way more elegantly than I ever could about
the problem of Strong Female Characters in films. We so desperately need to get our act together.

I wholeheartedly agree with everything she says, and won't waste more of your
time repeating myself -- the article is very worthwhile.
