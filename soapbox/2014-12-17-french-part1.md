Introduction
============

So i recently came across a blog, written by someone who had emigrated
to the Netherlands. The author describes her frustrations and
surprises (and occasionally her joyful moments, it would seem)
encountered there. I had a chuckle at a few of the posts (which were
more or less recognisable, given the considerable time i've spent in
the Netherlands myself), and couldn't help thinking that i could do
this, too. After all, the French do some crazy shit too, and what
better fun than to engage in some light-hearted ribbing, rooted in
cultural imperialism and intolerance?

Touching
--------

When one is used to the Netherlands, with their
[kissing](http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/11/06/3-three-kisses/),
one might think that things can only get better elsewhere in the
world. Firstly, being a proper Dutchie[^1], i know that the way to
_faire la bise_ is not once, not twice, but thrice. Right, left,
right. But here, one is set up for an awkward start, going back a
third time, risking looking like you were enjoying it too much, even
though if it was up to you, you wouldn't have started in the first
place. One should also note that back in the Netherlands, i hardly
ever did that: only older family-type people would require it, while
all my actual friends would get the northern European side-glancing
"hey" (never show any emotion: your friends might cotton on to the
fact that you appreciate them).

Fine, though, after a few days the twice-not-thrice rule is bound to
start sticking. The bigger problem is that this is something that
literally *everybody* does, super unironically. Friends who have known
each other for years, people your friends have just introduced you to,
but perhaps worst of all, even colleagues.  Imagine you've just
arrived at work, it's early, the sun is hardly shining outside, you
haven't had time to grab your coffee yet, but you've first got to walk
around, smiling, touching everybody. Indeed it's kisses if more than
zero of the participants identify as women, and hands for any other combinations
(indeed, see also: ingrained sexism). If you don't really like this (e.g. if you are a
crypto-autist,
hypochondriac, or for any other reason), be sure that this will be taken as
a direct personal affront. Every time. No such thing as getting used to
foreigners and their idiosyncrasies[^2] ;).

Anyway, even if you don't like touchy people, it's probably good for your microbial
resistance to invade other people's airspace on a regular basis ;).


[^1]: This is a whole other subject. Depending on my mood, i will either identify as anglophone
or Dutch, whichever happens to be "better" in that situation. There is of course no hypocrisy in that.
I will readily note that just like all other societies, the Dutch have their fair share of unreasonable
mores. They might even get knocked in a future instalment, stay tuned.


[^2]: No, i jest. It just can be exhausting sometimes, as with any foreign environment.
