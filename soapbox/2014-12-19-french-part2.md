Normativity
===========

I'm going to start off this instalment by saying that i don't much
like the idea of normativity. On the other hand, i'll be the first to
admit that we apes (uh, primates, humans, as you wish) are probably to
a certain extent incapable of escaping socialised and normative
behaviour in most aspects of our daily dealings. I suspect that we'd
have to try really hard to erode various culturally ingrained aspects
of our behaviour if somehow we become convinced that they are
undesirable. Closer to home, as much as i like ragging others (the
French in this case) for their group-think and silly customs, i will
also admit that this is _a)_ in jest, and _b)_ just as prevalent in
[cultures i am used to](http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2010/11/26/no-56-normalcy-doe-normaal/),
but differently. I think this is
normal, and anyone who transplants from a given culture _C₁_ into a
culture _C₁_ for any _C₁ ≠ C₂_ will probably confirm that various
things seem silly/perplexing/obscure in their new surroundings, even
if back home in _C₁_ they do equally weird things, but are simply used
to them.

This won't, however, stop me from employing a bit of
good old _mauvaise foi_ and poking fun at them anyway.


Food Normativity
================

Today i will be ranting about food. And normativity. Specifically, the
French have a penchant for making judgements on others' correct (or
otherwise) approach to victuals.  Obviously, there is only One True Way
when it comes to food. The "objective best way" for food is clearly a
roundabout way of saying "the way French people do it". The French
are notorious [citation needed] for being insufferably conceited when
it comes to their own _cuisine_, which probably only got worse since
it was declared "world intangible heritage" by UNESCO.

For example, being a vegetarian in France is a downright struggle,
since the concept of not cutting live animals' throats to force feed
them, and then harvesting their livers, all in support of some
"festive season" (surely not for the animals) is widely regarded as a
comically impractical proposition. Not subscribing to the
starch-greens-and-dead-animals eating paradigm will garner 
concern for your health and well-being, but congenial as this may seem,
i perceive it as thinly-veiled contempt for anything more foreign or
faraway than the fence-posts of your rural farm. Not eating animals is
something that happens exclusively in newfangled cities, and India, it would seem.
It's a way, if you will, of displaying street cred,   saying, "look at how cool i am, i
have never experienced other culinary cultures!".

This faux naivete extends to most situations concerning food.     As is probably
apparent, i find it rather difficult to tolerate, and the locals find it difficult to
contain their amazement at every turn. After the nth time someone puts
on a concerned frown and asks, with a characteristic gratingly naive rising inflection, if

* tu manges debout?! (for eating a snack while standing, without having laid the table and lit the candles)
* tu manges beurre de cacahuette sur une baguette?! (admittedly a strange combination, but when rushed, bread and peanut butter really cannot be beaten)
* tu manges salé à 16h de l'après-midi?! (late breakfast → late lunch → confused French)
* etc., you get the drift,

one starts feeling like shouting that one can, in fact, eat perfectly
satisfactorily while standing, simultaneously holding a conversation
and a beer, and that no, one will not stop eating one's lunch at
4p.m., even if you consider that an affront to decency and/or normalcy.

Other than that, the locals are a friendly bunch, and will perfectly happy try out your
exotic concoctions -- don't let my raving put you off. After having
shouted a bit[^3] i already feel a lot better about things, so i'll now go
for an apéro at exactly the condoned time. I definitely seem to
appreciate my own customs and habits a lot more after having travelled
a bit -- perhaps the Dutch weren't so bad after all? ...and worse
still, perhaps i'm being partly assimilated
into the obscure French culture? The horror! :)
