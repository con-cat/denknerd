title: Turkey Pardon?!
---

Apparently some people have reached the epitomy of consumer culture, at the same time as an all-time low
in self-awareness with regards to hipocrisy.

It would seem that a bizarre ritual has started in the States, the so-called Turkey Pardon, where one or two turkeys
will _not_ be eaten for Thanksgiving. So evidently, people are vaguely aware that eating animals is a cruel and distasteful
activity, but instead of just ignoring that fact as much as possible as they normally do, now it's becoming
a flagrant joke, in bad taste, at that. It almost feels like a perverse kind of playing with your food.

Ugh, this is distasteful on so many levels. Just fucking stop with the animal-eating already, people!
