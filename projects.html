<p>Occasionally, I work on something unrelated to work. Usually this is to solve some niche
frustration I have (I can be a very frustrated guy). You might be able to do something with
my tinkerings.</p>


<h2>Programming projects</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush/spotiqueue">Spotiqueue</a>, nicer queues for
    Spotify. It scrobbles.
    [<a href="http://denknerd.org/files/Spotiqueue.app.zip">download</a>]</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush/dotfs">DotFS</a>, scratching my configuration
    itch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/toothbrushphotos">Flickr</a>, where I show off some of my
    photography. I don't much enjoy photographing people.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.denknerd.org/wiki">Recipes</a>, my personal wiki where I keep track of
    recipes I've “borrowed” from various sources.</li>
    <li><a href="http://last.fm/user/toothbrush">Last.fm</a>, where you can stalk my listening
    habits. I'm quite partial to music in general.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush">GitHub</a>, coding voyeurism.</li>
</ul>
