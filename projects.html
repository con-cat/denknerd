<p>Occasionally, i work on something unrelated to work. Usually this is to solve some niche
frustration i have (i can be a very frustrated guy). You might be able to do something with
my tinkerings.</p>


<h2>Programming projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/">Guix</a>, the
    functional package manager and system distribution!  Not my
    project, but i'm certainly a fan.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush/dotfs">DotFS</a>,
    scratching my configuration itch.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush/spotiqueue">Spotiqueue</a>,
    nicer queues for Spotify. It scrobbles.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/toothbrushphotos">Flickr</a>,
    where i show off some of my photography. I don't much enjoy
    photographing people. I really need to update this.</li>
  <li><a href="/recipes-index.html">Recipes</a>, my
    personal <del>wiki</del> where i keep track of recipes i've
    “borrowed” from various sources.</li>
  <li><a href="http://last.fm/user/toothbrush">Last.fm</a>, where you
    can stalk my listening habits. I'm quite partial to music in
    general.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/toothbrush">GitHub</a>, coding
  voyeurism.</li>
</ul>
