== Ingredients for brigadeiro ==

For one portion:
* 1 can of condensed milk;
* 4 (soup) spoonful of cocoa powder;
* 30-50g (one (soup) spoonful) of unsalted butter;
* 50g of "Chocolade cripsbolletjes".

You can use salted butter and it may enhance the flavor, depending on your tastes.

== Method ==

#Put everything in a pan large enough to give you room to mix it. Notice you might need to mix a little fast at the end, so relatively tall pans are preferable.
#Mix it with a wooden spoon until it is more or less homogeneous.
#Put the pan on low heat and keep mixing. Remember to clean up the edges and keep stirring the bottom so it doesn't stick/burn and don't stop stirring. At first it's going to soften a lot but after a while it's going to harden.
#Every now and then try to turn the pan so that you can check the bottom. When it is viscous enough for the mix to fall as a block and you can see small bubbles being formed at the bottom, it should be time to take out of the heat.
#Leave it to cool down on its own for some minutes and then it's ready to put on the fridge.
#Spread the "cripsbolletjes" on a soup plate.
#Spread some butter on your hands.
#With a spoon, take small portions from the pan and make small balls by rolling it against both of your hands.
#Spread it around on the soup plate so it gets the "cripsbolletjes".
#Make another one after you notice you've eaten that one before showing anyone else.
#Seriously, stop eating this as soon as you make them.
