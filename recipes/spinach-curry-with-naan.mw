== Ingredients ==

* large onion
* garlic
* curry paste (e.g. Patak)
* block of frozen spinach
* roughly 4 fresh tomatoes
* block of feta
* naan bread 


== Method ==

Heat some vegetable oil, add curry paste and onions, chopped. When onions are sauted, add chopped tomatoes and reduce. Finally add spinach and melt / mix, not forgetting the garlic at some point. Now is a good point to stick the naan into the oven, and when that's done, add diced feta to mixture. Serve and enjoy.
