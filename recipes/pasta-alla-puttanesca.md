Ingredients
-----------

-   onion (lots; diced)
-   garlic (lots; diced or crushed as you like)
-   olives (whole, pitted, or diced, as you like)
-   capers
-   anchovies (25 to 50g, as you like)
-   cherry tomatoes
-   tomato purée
-   parmesan (optional)
-   basil (optional; preferably crushed, otherwise diced)
-   pasta of choice (penne work well)

Method
------

Fry the onion in olive oil until it's soft/translucent; not too hot so
as to avoid discolouration. Reduce the heat then add the garlic and
sautée for a minute as the pan cools. Then add the olives, capers,
anchovies and cherry tomatoes, mix around (so the anchovies break up)
until the ingredients are warm, say about a minute. Then add tomato
purée, parmesan and basil, leave on heat until hot enough (no longer --
we don't want the tomatoes to disintegrate). Done. Mix with pasta of
choice cooked in parallel. Serve with extra parmesan.
