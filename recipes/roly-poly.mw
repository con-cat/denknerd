Note: dough seemed too buttery as it was rather sticky and all the jam escaped quite fast. Also, watch out with the salt. 

==tiny pudding:==
* jam (apricot)
* 1 cup flour (+/- 125g or a little more)
* 125g butter
* .5 tsp baking powder
* water and salt

# preheat oven to 190deg C
# grease dish
# rub butter into dry ingredients (preferably with fork/fingertips, so butter doesn't melt)
# take drops of water to bind the mixture
# roll out pastry (possibly after "resting")
# brush edges with water
# spread jam in the middle
# bake until light golden brown (20-30 minutes)

==sauce:==
* alcohol
* .5 cup sugar (100g)
* 1 cup water (in fact I used about 100ml and it was almost too runny (as a result of too much booze/too little thickener?))
* pinch salt
* cinnamon stick/teaspoon ground cinnamon

# boil the lot up and thicken with say a heaped teaspoon of flour blended with a little milk (no lumps!)
# (while the sugar and water is boiling stir in the thickener)
# take off the heat and add either dessert wine/OBS or brandy (whisky might work too)
