Makes 10 large or 18-20 small.

== Ingredients ==

* 62.5g flour
* 37.5g margarine
* 2 large eggs
* 150ml water

== Method ==

# Heat oven to 190 deg C.
# Place water and margarine to boil.
# When boiling, add flour all at once and stir until it forms a smooth mass, leaving the sides of the pan clean. 
# Remove from stove and allow to cool for about five minutes or so. 
# Beat in eggs, one at a time, and beat REALLY WELL. The mixture should look like very very thick cream.
# Beat _really_ well. This is most important and you cannot over beat this cake.
# For large eclairs, use a dessert spoon, for small ones a teaspoon, and put the spoonfuls onto a greased baking pan.
# Bake at 190 C for 35-40 minutes (large) or 30 minutes (small).
# DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN UNTIL THE BAKING TIME IS UP. Otherwise, the cakes will sink in.
# Immediately you take them out the oven, make a slit in the side of each eclair to let the steam escape.
# When cold, fill with whipped cream, slightly sweetened and flavoured with vanilla. 
# Cover top with chocolate icing.

===Icing===

# Use about .5 cup of icing sugar and .25 cup of cocoa, a few spots of vanilla. Mix with lukewarm water until just thin enough to spread. 

Note: If you make these the day before, do not store in a tin or they will go soft.
