''serves: 3+''

==Ingredients==

* half a spherical cabbage, washed and very thinly sliced
* (optional: 2 cups shredded carrots)
* enough chopped ginger
* block of tofu
* white wine or rice vinegar
* sesame seed or peanut oil, soya sauce
* 2+ eggs
* bunch of fresh coriander
* glassy or rice noodles
* half cup of vegetable stock, prepare ahead of time
* 1, 2 fresh green chilies or some kind of paste
* 2-5 large cloves of garlic

== Method ==

# Blocks of tofu: marinade in tabasco/cayenne pepper/balsamico/olive oil/pepper, the usual, whatever comes to mind

Wait an hour+.

# Wash and slice the cabbage very thinly.
# Make ½ cup of bouillon and add a ½ tsp sugar, 2 tbsp soya sauce, 2 tsp vinegar.
# Beat an egg, add salt, then add it to a rather hot wok with some oil. When set flip, then remove, slice, set  side. Do this twice.
# Add chopped garlic and ginger to the hot, wok, with some extra oil.
# Within about 30s, add the tofu. Fry a while until it all starts browning.
# Add cabbage and keep it moving until it starts to reduce.
# Probably a reasonable point to cover the noodles in boiling water separately.
# Add bouillon mixture and black pepper, let it reduce again.
# When done add cilantro, then after a while stir in the noodles (which have been drained elsewhere).
# Perhaps add oyster sauce / salt / pepper / chili (paste) to taste.

Serve, yay!
