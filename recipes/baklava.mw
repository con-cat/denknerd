Makes 2 dozen

== Ingredients ==

* 1 cup unsalted butter
* 1/2 pound of phyllo dough
* 2 cups chopped pecans (actually should be pistachio?)
* (1.5 tbsp cloves, whole -- omitted)
* 1.5 cups water
* 1.3 cup white sugar 
* 1 cinnamon stick 
* 1 cup honey

== Method ==

# Preheat oven to 175 deg C
# Melt butter over low heat. Pout 2 tbsp of the butter into the bottom of a 13x9inch baking pan. Layer 3 sheets of the phyllo dough in the pan. Trim dough to fit.
# Sprinkle 2 tbsp of pecans over the phyllo dough
# Layer 3 more sheets of dough, brush generously with the melted butter, and sprinkle  with 2 tbsp of the pecans. Continue dough - butter - pecan layers until pan is 3/4 full.
# With a sharp knife, score the phyllo dough to form diamonds. Press a clove at each end of the diamonds. Pour remaining butter over the dough.
# Bake 45 to 50 mins, until dough is golden brown. 
# While dough is baking, combine the sugar, water and cinnamon stick in medium saucepan and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer for 10 minutes.
# Add the honey and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon stick. 
# Pour honey mixture over hot baklava. Let cool on wire racks. Cut into diamonds.
